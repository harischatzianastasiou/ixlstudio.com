Then comes the hard part: turning that into a habit. I try to work in small steps, document as I go, and keep the scope tight so I can actually finish.</p><p>Sharing the process (here and on YouTube) keeps me accountable and helps me see the path from “early idea” to “something playable.” This article is a placeholder — you can edit <code>articles.json</code> and change this content to whatever you like.
